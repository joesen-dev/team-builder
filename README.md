## Installation

You will need Node.js to run the application. You can find a guide on installation [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

**Step 1**

> Clone the repository to your local machine.

**Step 2**

> cd to the directory with your cloned repo. In this case, you'll want to be in the "Develop" directory.

**Step 3**
The repo comes with a package.json with the required dependencies to type the following command into your CLI

> `npm install`

You should now see a directory called node_modules and a package-lock.json.

Now youâ€™re ready to start building your Team!

## Usage

##### To run the application, type enter <sub>_node \<filename\>_</sub> into your command prompt.

**Use case example**

> `node index.js`
